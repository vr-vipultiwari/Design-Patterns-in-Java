# Design-Patterns-in-Java

This Repository Contains all the Design Pattern and Solid Principle Example in order to write better quality code


## INTRODUCTION
---------------

🌀 We do lot of repatative work in our daily life like get up in the morning , brush our teeth , drive to a certain distance , do work ,sleep.
Same goes with the software , when you write code , you end up repeating yourself quite a bit so when we repeat things those are called patterns.

🌀 So we as a software engineer faces common problem during developemnt of various software programs,some of these common problems are already been solved 
by some smart developer and they have provided us the solution of those common problem in form of design patterns.

🌀 Design Pattern consist of set of rules describing how to accomplish certain task in the interest of software development.

🌀 Design Pattern represents the best practices used by experienced software developers , these are tried and tested solution to most common problem in software design 
that one should use to write better quality code

🌀 Design Patterns not only talk about designing the object but also talks about interaction between the object like how they should communicate and work togeather

🌀 There are basically 23 design patterns provided by Gang of four architects. these patterns are divided into three categories ( creational , behavioral , structural )

🔼 ## ADVANTAGES OF DESIGN PATTERNS 
-----------------------------------

The most commonly stated reason to use design pattern because of the following reason :- 

☑️ Use the best solution to certain problem faced during software development 
             - Makes its easier to reuse successfull design and Architecture 
             - Learning these patterns makes its easier for unexprienced developer to learn software design in easy and faster way

☑️ With the help of these design pattern , one can easily understand basic object oriented principle to achieve high quality design.
                - Its not like that your code should produce only correct output but it should also be scalable and maintainable at the same time
                
☑️ Design Patterns improves the modifiablity and maintainablity of the code that means we can change the code much easier without breaking other things.

☑️We can find and fix bugs much easier if we use design pattern because things will be loosely coupled and highly cohesive.



🔼 ## TYPES OF DESIGN PATTERN 
------------------------------

⚛️ Design Pattern are organised into family of related pattern , this makes its easier to learn and focus on specific type of use cases. 
 
⚛️ All these 23 Design Patterns have different level of granularity and they all have specific application that they can focus on.

⚛️ ALL these design pattern are divided into three categories based on the problem they solve . These three types are
                 
                 - Creational Design Pattern  : These type of Design pattern mainly focuses on Object Creation 
                 - Structural Design Pattern  : These type of Design pattern mainly focuses on Composition of object and classes , How these class are inter-related  
                 - Behavoiral Design Pattern  : These  type of Design Pattern focuses on communication between the objects like how they interact with each other
                 
⚛️ These three design pattern further categorised based on the scope they have like wheather they can be applied primarily to object or classes.

                 -- Class Pattern : These Patterns deals with relation between classed and sub-classes  
                 -- Object Pattern : These Pattern deals with Object Realationship that meaans they can be changed at run-time making them much more dynamic
                                     it also describe how object can be composed into larger structure using object composition or by including object into 
                                     other object
